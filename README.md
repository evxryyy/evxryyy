Hi, I'm evxry.

I'm a Roblox developer with over 3 years of experience. I focus on building open-source libraries and developer tools, including modules like `Buffer` and other core utilities aimed at improving workflow and performance.

In addition to Roblox development, I also work with C#. I create systems, tools, and gameplay features across both Roblox and Unity projects. My goal is to provide clean, reliable, and reusable code that helps other developers build faster and more efficiently.
